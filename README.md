Purpose:

        This program functions as a "radar" by classifying flying
        objects as either a bird or an airplane given data pertaining
        to the object's velocity. Classifications are made via an
        implementation of a Naive Bayesian Classifier.


Files:

        data.txt     -   Input data
        pdf.txt      -   Input data
        radar.py     -   Contains all source code


Compiling:

        python radar.py


Usage:

        As the program accepts no additional arguments from the
        command line, testing other data sets would require editing
        the source code (radar.py lines 107-108) to reflect different
        file names.
